For instance, a package weighing 1.2 pounds will be billed at the 2-pound rate. Dimensional weight is calculated using the following formula: length x width x height, in inches / 139.
                    <br>For Ocean Freight, shipping fees are based on the actual volume of the package, regardless of its weight, and are calculated and measured in pounds. 
                    <br>Storage fees will be applied to all packages that are not collected within seven (7) business days.
                    <br>Customers agree to pay the shipping charges prior receiving the shipment.

                    <br>Please note that for USPS packages, when tracking indicates that a package has been delivered, it signifies delivery to the local post office rather than to the final recipient’s address. Therefore, EazzyReShip will not accept claims for package delivery in such instances.

At this stage, an internal tracking number, referred to as a warehouse number, is generated. From this point forward, the package is tracked using the internal tracking number.
                    <br>Once your package is received at our U.S. warehouse and assigned to your account, you will be notified via email. The notification will include pictures of the package, along with the vendor’s tracking number and our internal tracking number.
                    <br>We will only accept claims for packages that have been delivered to our U.S. warehouse, provided that proof of delivery is submitted. This proof may include either a signature from authorized personnel at our U.S. warehouse or a picture clearly showing the package has been delivered to our facility.
